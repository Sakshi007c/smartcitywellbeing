# 🌍 SmartCity Sentinel — NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

*Category:* Earth & Environment  
*Team:* Quantum Squad  
*Challenge Theme:* Data for Sustainable Urban Living  
*Submission Year:* 2025  


## 🚀 Project Overview

*SmartCity Sentinel* is an integrated dashboard that visualizes real-time environmental and urban indicators to help city planners, emergency services, and citizens make *data-driven decisions* for a more sustainable and resilient future.

Our platform combines satellite data, IoT feeds, and open data APIs into a *unified city intelligence dashboard* — enabling better responses to:

- 🌫 *Air Pollution* hotspots  
- 🌡 *Urban Heat Stress* zones  
- 🌳 *Green Space Distribution*

By providing a holistic view of urban environmental health, SmartCity Sentinel helps municipalities identify patterns, plan mitigation strategies, and communicate transparent data insights to the public.

## 🛰 Problem Statement

Modern cities face escalating challenges due to *climate change, **rapid urbanization, and **pollution*.  
Data exists — but it’s *fragmented* across multiple systems.

NASA’s Earth observation data, when integrated with local sensors, can revolutionize *city monitoring and response systems*.  
Our goal: make this data *actionable, accessible, and visual* through a smart, modular dashboard.
